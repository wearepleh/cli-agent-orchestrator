"""Terminal service with workflow functions.

This module provides high-level terminal management operations that orchestrate
multiple components (database, tmux, providers) to create a unified terminal
abstraction for CLI agents.

Key Responsibilities:
- Terminal lifecycle management (create, get, delete)
- Provider initialization and cleanup
- Tmux session/window management
- Terminal output capture and message extraction

Terminal Workflow:
1. create_terminal() → Creates tmux window, initializes provider, starts logging
2. send_input() → Sends user message to the agent via tmux
3. get_output() → Retrieves agent response from terminal history
4. delete_terminal() → Cleans up provider, database record, and logging

    This function orchestrates the complete terminal creation workflow:
    1. Generate unique terminal ID and window name
    2. Create tmux session/window (new or existing)
    3. Save terminal metadata to database
    4. Initialize the CLI provider (starts the agent)
    5. Set up terminal logging via tmux pipe-pane

    Args:
        provider: Provider type string (e.g., "kiro_cli", "claude_code")
        agent_profile: Name of the agent profile to use
        session_name: Optional custom session name. If not provided, auto-generated.
        new_session: If True, creates a new tmux session. If False, adds to existing.
        working_directory: Optional working directory for the terminal shell
        env_vars: Operator-forwarded env vars (``cao launch --env``). On
            ``new_session=True``, these are stored on the session record and
            inherited by every worker spawned later in the same session. On
            ``new_session=False``, the persisted session vars are merged in
            automatically and the explicit ``env_vars`` argument is merged on
            top, winning on key conflict — per-step vars (e.g. workflow
            routing ids) must reach the window even inside an existing
            session. See issues #248 and #408.
        caller_id: Terminal ID of the supervisor that created this terminal
            via handoff/assign. Recorded so send_message can route callbacks
            structurally instead of parsing IDs out of message text (issue #284).
            None for operator-launched terminals.
        engine: Explicit Kiro engine. For Kiro, it must agree with the selected
            profile's engine when both are present; omitted resolves to v2.
        kiro_capability_probe: Optional test seam for the bounded wrapper probe.
        model: Explicit per-call model override, forwarded to the provider
            (where supported -- see each provider's own __init__) ahead of
            the agent profile's own static `model` field. Lets a caller
            (e.g. MCP handoff/assign's own `model` parameter) pin a specific
            model for one worker without needing a dedicated agent profile.
            None = behavior unchanged (profile.model, if any, still applies).
        use_worktree: If True, provision an isolated ``git worktree`` (issue
            #100) for this terminal instead of using ``working_directory`` as
            given -- resolves the repo root from ``working_directory`` (or the
            server's own cwd when unset), creates a fresh worktree on its own
            branch there, and overrides ``working_directory`` to the new
            worktree path before the tmux session/window is created. Requires
            the resolved directory to actually be inside a git repository.
        group: Ordered, general-to-specific grouping array for list_siblings
            discovery (#432). None = this terminal opts out of discovery.
        metadata: Free-form JSON describing what this terminal is doing.
            Also updatable later by the running agent via the
            ``update_metadata`` MCP tool.

    Returns:
        Terminal object with all metadata populated

    fixed value is used for the history capture and the escalating-fetch

    This is a SEPARATE read path from ``get_output``: that function returns the
    bounded rolling buffer / tmux tail, whereas this reads an exact byte window
    from ``TERMINAL_LOG_DIR / f"{terminal_id}.log"`` — the append-only,
    monotonic file LogWriter maintains (BR-1). Playback (FR-4.3 / FR-7.3) uses
    the ``terminal_offset_start`` / ``terminal_offset_len`` an event carries to
    fetch exactly the output produced around that event, without copying the
    log into the journal (BR-3).

    Args:
        terminal_id: The terminal whose log to read. Validated against the
            workflow name/id charset before it is joined into the log path, so
            a value containing ``/`` / ``..`` / a NUL can never escape
            ``TERMINAL_LOG_DIR`` (path-traversal defense; reuses
            ``_validate_key_part``).
        offset: Byte offset to seek to. Must be ``>= 0``. An offset at or beyond
            EOF is not an error — the read simply returns the available tail
            (empty string when nothing follows the offset) so playback degrades
            gracefully (BR-4).
        length: Maximum number of bytes to read. Clamped to
            ``TERMINAL_RANGE_MAX_LENGTH`` (BR-2) to bound the read.

    Returns:
        The decoded slice, ``bytes.decode("utf-8", errors="replace")`` so a
        range that starts or ends mid-multibyte-sequence never raises (BR-5,
        matching LogWriter's write encoding). Returns ``""`` for a valid
        terminal whose log does not exist yet (nothing has been logged) — a
        missing log is NOT a playback-breaking error (BR-4).

    Raises:
        ValueError: ``terminal_id`` fails id validation, or ``offset`` is
            negative. Translated to a 400 at the request boundary.
        OSError: A genuine file I/O failure (e.g. a permission error, or the

    """Re-adopt persisted terminals after a cao-server restart.

    ``create_terminal`` is the only place the FIFO -> EventBus logging
    pipeline is armed, so restarting cao-server used to leave live tmux
    agents half-adopted: the pane keeps running, but its ``<tid>.log`` stops
    growing and status detection observes nothing. For every persisted
    terminal row:

    - tmux window still alive: re-arm the pipeline — recreate the FIFO
      reader (same probe/re-arm closures ``create_terminal`` uses) and
      stop+start pipe-pane so the pane streams into the fresh FIFO (a bare
      pipe_pane() would toggle a still-registered pipe OFF).
    - window gone (reboot / tmux kill / crash): finalize — recover a
      ``.scrollback`` from the ANSI-stripped ``<tid>.log`` if none exists
      (crashes never ran the delete-path capture), then drop the DB row so
      it does not linger as an orphan until retention cleanup.

    Providers need no re-registration: ``provider_manager.get_provider``
    rebuilds instances on demand from the DB row. Event-inbox backends
    (herdr) deliver output via their own socket events, so there is nothing
    to re-arm there.
