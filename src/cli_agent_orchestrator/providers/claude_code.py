#   latch (the exact #392 bug) — the tail keywords carry the disambiguation

        """Auto-accept startup prompts that may appear before the REPL is ready.

        Claude Code may show up to two prompts during startup:

        1. **Bypass permissions confirmation** (``--dangerously-skip-permissions``)
           – shows "Yes, I accept" as option 2; requires ``Down`` + ``Enter``.
           The settings-based fix (``_ensure_skip_bypass_prompt_setting``) prevents
           this in most cases; this handler is a defensive fallback.
        2. **Workspace trust dialog** – shows "Yes, I trust this folder";
           requires ``Enter``.

        Idle-gap semantics (see issue #400): a cold or containerized start can
        render these dialogs LATE and in sequence, past the old fixed ~20s
        window. Instead of a total-window budget, ``idle_gap`` is the maximum
        quiet stretch tolerated BETWEEN prompts: the loop keeps polling and
        resets the idle timer every time it answers a prompt, exiting only once
        no new prompt appears for ``idle_gap`` seconds. Total runtime is still
        hard-capped by ``outer_timeout`` so a wedged start cannot hang init
        indefinitely.

        The idle-gap exit is gated on having handled at least one prompt.
        ``last_prompt_time`` has no real "last prompt" to measure from until
        the FIRST one arrives, so treating the handler's start time as if it
        were one let a first dialog later than ``idle_gap`` (e.g. issue #400's
        own cold-node-plus-gateway-connect scenario) get missed entirely — the
        loop would exit at the idle-gap boundary having never seen it. Before
        any prompt has been observed, only ``outer_timeout`` can end the loop;
        the idle-gap clock starts only once a prompt has actually been handled.

        This method is awaited directly from initialize(), which runs on
        cao-server's single asyncio event loop. Every tmux-backed call here
        is offloaded via ``asyncio.to_thread`` and every sleep is
        ``asyncio.sleep`` (see #451): a blocking ``time.sleep``/subprocess
        exec here would freeze the WHOLE OS thread, serializing every other
        in-flight request for as long as this loop ran.

        Args:
            idle_gap: Seconds of no-new-prompt quiet that ends the loop. Defaults
                to the ``startup_prompt_handler_timeout`` setting.
            outer_timeout: Hard cap (seconds) on total handler runtime. Defaults
                to the ``provider_init_timeout`` setting; initialize() passes the
                per-profile-resolved value so a containerized profile's longer
                init budget also governs this handler.
